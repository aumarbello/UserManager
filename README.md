# User Manager

This repository contains a simple demo API built with NodeJS.
The API is used to manage users in a MongoDB database.

### Development
This application was developed using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/). MongoDB was used for persisting data with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping).

### Installation
* Start up your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows OS).
* Ensure that you've `Docker` installed on your PC.
* Run the startapp.sh script file to start the application, for linux users simply run `sh startapp.sh` in your terminal and type your password if prompted. For windows users install any application that includes a Bash shell and use the same command. Recommended application - [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)

### Testing
To ensure that your installation is successful you'll need to run tests.
The command: `npm test` makes this possible. It isn't functional right now, but once it's done you'll be notified via the README.

### API Documentation
The API only has one endpoint which is the `/users` endpoint for saving users to the database. The endpoint works with the HTTP verbs: `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.
